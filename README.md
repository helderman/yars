# YARS - Yet Another Retro Shooter
This was the result of a presentation I gave in front of my colleagues
at Exact on March 1, 2018.
I created a [shmup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up)
from scratch in just over an hour.
I was using no frameworks, no stock images and no stock sound effects.
My only tools were:

- A computer with OS, command shell, web browser and web server
- [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))
  (customized; yeah, I cheated a bit there)
- [GIMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP)
- [SoX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoX)

Later that year, I redid the whole thing in my attic.
It was less fun without the audience and without the
[Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross) intro,
but the recording was better,
making it possible to follow exactly what I am doing.
